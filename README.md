## How to use the app
Use the remove button associated with each project to remove that project from the list. You can add a new project by using the form fields and the submit button beneath the list.

## Future Developments
I intend to develop an alerts feature where users can view alerts associated with each project and a sub-task feature where users can add phases or sub-tasks to a project. The progress bar will be filled depending on the percentage of completed sub-tasks.
